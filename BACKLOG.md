# BACKLOG.md — Moody build queue
Work top-down. Format: `[ID] (est) Task — Acceptance criteria`. Statuses: `TODO / IN-PROGRESS / DONE / BLOCKED(Q#) / NEEDS-VISUAL-REVIEW`.

## M0 — Skeleton
- [M0-0] **[DONE 2026-07-07]** (90m) Consistency read — read ALL docs end-to-end (requirements, build-spec, TEST_CASES, DECISIONS); log every contradiction, ambiguity, or decision-vs-spec drift to QUESTIONS.md; propose fixes in the first Decision Digest. Do NOT resolve unilaterally. **AC:** a written findings list (even if empty) in RUNLOG before any code. → findings F1–F12 in QUESTIONS.md; digest D-32…D-36.
- [M0-0b] **[DONE 2026-07-07 — APPROVED 2026-07-09 (F13)]** (45m) Extend this backlog — draft task breakdowns for M3–M8 at the same criteria-tagged granularity as M0–M2; mark AI-prompt tasks as review-gated. **AC:** backlog covers all milestones; Ria approves in a digest. → drafted below (M3–M8 + Phase 2 pointer); M4/M5 flagged oversized (split candidates). Approval parked in QUESTIONS (F13).
- [M0-1] **[DONE 2026-07-07]** (60m) Xcode project scaffold — SwiftUI app target, SwiftData container, test target builds and runs an empty test. **AC:** `xcodebuild test` green in simulator. → 2/2 passing, iPhone 17 Pro sim (iOS 26.5).
- [M0-2] **[DONE 2026-07-07]** (90m) Core models, people — `FamilyMember`, `DietaryRequirement`, `FoodNeedGoal`, `MemberMealScore` per spec §2. **AC:** round-trip persistence tests; TC §1 model-level invariants compile. → 8 tests, fresh-context decode verified; adversarial review applied (F14/F15 parked).
- [M0-3] **[DONE 2026-07-07]** (90m) Core models, food — `Ingredient`, `Recipe`, `RecipeKind`, `RecipeItem` incl. tri-state `isGlutenFreeVerified`. **AC:** loose recipe with nil amounts persists; TC-HC-6 passes. → 12 tests incl. HC-6 both paths + D-36 mixed precision; safety review applied (F16/F16b conservative defaults pinned).
- [M0-4] **[DONE 2026-07-07]** (90m) Core models, meals & planning — `Meal`, `PlanEntry`, `ThemeAnchor`, enums. **AC:** meal with zero recipes + freeform text is valid (TC-DM-3). → 7 tests; review caught + fixed a SwiftData implicit-inverse data-corruption bug (F17); DM-5/DM-6 tests parked on D-37.
- [M0-5] **[DONE 2026-07-07]** (60m) Core models, shopping/inventory/etc — `ShoppingRun/Item`, `Snack`, `PurchaseRecord`, `InventoryItem`, `WasteEvent`, `CheckIn`, `WeeklyReflection`, `FridgeSpec` (+`StapleItem`). **AC:** persistence tests for each. → unblocked by D-34; 10 tests; D-33 leftover fields + `staple` source in; Elsie's lifeline staples seeded (D-6).
- [M0-6] **[DONE 2026-07-07]** (45m) Seed data — the five household members with hard requirements/soft goals per requirements doc; ~15 seed meals incl. GF-verified and unverified items, one all-time favorite, one Taco-Tuesday-tagged meal. **AC:** seed loads idempotently; used by all later tests. → 16 meals, 24 ingredients, Wednesday b4d anchor seeded OFF; done ahead of M0-5 (blocked on D-34).
- [M0-7] **[DONE 2026-07-07 — NEEDS-VISUAL-REVIEW]** (90m) Basic CRUD screens for meals/recipes (list + edit). **AC:** builds, creates/edits persist. → Meals/Recipes tabs, tri-state GF badges, D-37-safe deletes; screenshot in docs/screenshots/; 3 CRUD tests. **M0 COMPLETE.**

## M1 — Plan + see
- [M1-1] **[DONE 2026-07-07 — NEEDS-VISUAL-REVIEW]** (90m) Manual planning UI — week grid, assign meal to date+slot, lock toggle. **AC:** PlanEntry created/edited; lock persists. → Plan tab, both slots, week nav, HC-5 confirm flow built in; 7 tests; screenshot in docs/screenshots/.
- [M1-2] **[DONE 2026-07-07]** (90m) EventKit service — dedicated "Moody" calendar; create/update/delete events from PlanEntries; handle permission denial gracefully. **AC:** TC-CAL-1..4 (integration tests may be simulator-limited; document what's mockable). → 5 tests vs mock seam; EK adapter thin, manual-verify; sync wired into Plan tab.
- [M1-3] **[DONE 2026-07-07 — NEEDS-VISUAL-REVIEW]** (60m) Tonight view — today's dinner, swap button, per-member safe badge. **AC:** TC-SF-1..3. → 4 tests; per-member badges incl. GF-hard cap; swap records status. **M1 COMPLETE.**

## U — Unification completion (P2–P4 of UNIFICATION_PLAN.md; P0/P1 done + merged 2026-07-09)
- [U-0] (60m) DESIGN_REVIEW.md fixes (Ria's designer pass, in design_handoff_v2/) — adopt the label-contrast fix everywhere (retire `labelMuted`), de-sticker the week-plan date chip, restore swipe-back alongside the styled back chip, streaks caption derives from strip data (never contradicts the tiles), confetti z-order if cheap. **AC:** each review verdict closed or noted in RUNLOG; screenshots. NEEDS-VISUAL-REVIEW.
- [U-1] (90m) App Group store move — SwiftData store into the App Group container; widgets/Live Activity read a `MoodySnapshot` projection emitted on save (no cross-process SwiftData). **AC:** app + widgets show the same live data across relaunch; existing store data survives the move.
- [U-2] (90m) Surface canon-compliance pass — streak copy audit (D-13), badge states (tri-state = shipped interim per D-44; style minimally), HC-5 confirm styled to the kit (unsafe band only per D-44; yellow ceiling, no red — escalation-pattern gravity), edge-state voice pass (law 4/7) on every ported string. **AC:** ported strings/states pass the voice laws; screenshots. NEEDS-VISUAL-REVIEW.
- [U-3] (60m) Integrations homed — calendar sync + Reminders export move behind a Settings root with in-voice permission primers (toolbar entry retires only after Settings exists; DESIGN_BRIEF_V2 Wave-1 item 7 designs the surface). **AC:** CAL-1..4 stay green; export reachable from Settings. NEEDS-VISUAL-REVIEW.

## M2 — Shopping core
- [M2-1] **[DONE 2026-07-07]** (90m) Meal→items explosion — precise amounts summed, loose items listed without amounts, dedup. **AC:** TC-SL-1..5. → pure `ShoppingExplosion` service, 5 tests; GF qualifier carried for RT-6.
- [M2-2] **[DONE 2026-07-07]** (90m) Run tiers + routing — perishability/neededBy routing per spec §4 step 4. **AC:** TC-RT-1..6. → pure `RunRouting`, 6 tests; unroutable ⇒ violation for GT.
- [M2-3] **[DONE 2026-07-07]** (90m) Guarantee check v1 (no inventory) — coverage between now and next confirmed run; violation → structured result naming at-risk meals. **AC:** TC-GT-1..6. → 16 tests; adversarial review found 3 verified blockers (phantom purchases, day-vs-clock granularity, no freshness floor) — all fixed + mutation-pinned.
- [M2-4] **[DONE 2026-07-07]** (60m) Markdown + Reminders export of a run's list. **AC:** TC-SL-6; Reminders export behind permission check. → 3 tests; strictest-need-by merging (PT-7 spirit); Shopping tab UI ships with M2-5.
- [M2-5] (45m) Run skip/delay flow — recheck guarantee, produce at-risk report object (UI later). **AC:** TC-GT-7..8.
- [M2-6] (45m) Ingredient archive/retire + merge (added 2026-07-09 per D-39) — catalog ingredients get retire (hidden from pickers; recipes/history render unchanged) + merge-duplicates flow; hard delete never exposed. **AC:** retire hides from recipe-editor picker while existing references stay intact; merge re-points all six referencing edges; tests pin both (closes F19 crash class).

- [M4-0] **[TODO — D-42 answered 2026-07-09]** (2×90m — split candidate M4-0a/M4-0b) Generalize food rules + D-44 GF risk-class model (added 2026-07-09; amended twice per Ria) — **(a)** replace `DietaryRequirement`/`FoodNeedGoal` with per-member `FoodRule` per D-45 as amended — STRUCTURED record {member, direction: never/limit/boost, subject, reason, frequency window}, never freeform; assessment prompt built deterministically from rule fields; matching is generative annotation at capture (no manual tag taxonomy), output schema-validated {rule, verdict, reason}; scheduler consumes stored annotations deterministically; rule add/change ⇒ batch re-annotation; seed: Chuck limit red meat/pork ≤1×/wk; Ria boost iron/fiber/anti-inflammatory; Chad boost calorie-dense; Elsie NO rule (D-35 objective + scores + staples carry the end goal); rule-filterable recipe/ingredient views from stored annotations. **(b)** replace tri-state `isGlutenFreeVerified` with D-44 (as thrice-refined): recipe-level band {safe | awaitingSubstitution | unsafe | notCheckedYet} assigned by GENERATIVE ASSESSMENT via MoodyBrain at capture/edit (one call, result stored; rubric = Ria's bread/mac-n-cheese/tbsp-flour examples; PROMPT-REVIEW; offline → notCheckedYet + queue; *depends on M3-1/M3-2*), per-line suggested subs, Ria's overrides permanent and outranking re-assessment, per-ingredient preferred brand, per-recipe standard modifications, HOUSEHOLD standard substitutions with bulk-apply checklist (full preview names every recipe + exact line changing; per-recipe subs override household defaults), "awaiting substitution" indicator calm per design law #4, unsafe tier nuclear (aligns w/ HC-9 flour line); shopping list carries sub/preferred brands (RT-6 pipe); migration = batch assessment of existing recipe box → first-pass triage view. Per-person CHIPS per D-46 (❤️ from scores/all-timer; ✅/❌ from stored annotations vs each member's rules) on meal list/detail/picker + serves-X/loved-by-X filters; steak-and-potatoes example pinned as a test. **AC:** §1 REWRITTEN to D-44 invariants and submitted for Ria's sign-off before old tests are deleted (never silent); whole-food-never-prompts; awaiting-substitution is SCHEDULABLE incl. Caddie nights (badge rides to plan/Tonight; shopping line carries substitution-needed qualifier) while UNSAFE is excluded from auto-fill and keeps HC-5 warn-confirm on manual assignment; D-44 example pins: homemade-bread→unsafe, mac-n-cheese→calm question, tbsp-flour-in-20→calm question; sub-or-brand-documented ⇒ safe with indicator fully cleared; bulk-apply clears N ticked recipes in one action while unticked keep the flag; migration emits a reviewable first-pass triage (unsafe / awaiting-substitution piles, everything visible); manual band/profile overrides persist and outrank re-scores; add-a-rule-at-runtime (new restriction honored with zero code change). NEEDS-VISUAL-REVIEW (rule/brand/sub/bulk/triage UI).
